# Numpy feedforward neural network

Feedforward fully connected neural network coded in numpy. This was part of an assignment to a course of Machine Learning that I followed during my PhD.

The code implements a simple neural network that classifies two generated spirales of points into two respective classes. The structure of the network is as follows: 3 fully connected linear layers, two of which with a tanh acrivation funciton while the last one has a softmax activation funciton. The loss function used is the cross-entropy. 

The same framework is tested on the MNIST dataset.
